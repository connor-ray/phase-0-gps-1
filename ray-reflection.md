1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  * The concept I was struggling with the most was definitely push/pull requests. I can successfully run them but I never fully understood the idea but I feel like I understand better now
2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  * To elaborate, I have a lot more clarity on what is actually happening in a push/pull request.
3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  * I was constantly asking my guide question, some were when I would get stuck but it was more often that I was asking questions to understand things at a slightly deeper level.
4. What still confuses you about Git?
 * I don't think any specific concept still confuses me, it's more just needing to familiarize myself with the process and see it action more.
5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  * I was definitely a bit nervous and that definitely showed in my performance I think. I was overthinking certain steps are forgetting small details that I normally wouldn't. Unfortunately the other pair didn't show up which unfortunate because I was able to see how the normal procedure would go. It also made the challenge a bit harder to do because it wasn't designed for one person. I felt because I din't have a pair, I didn't get as much out of it. But overall I enjoyed and thought was very helpful and progressive.
